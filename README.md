 ## Installing
You can use Git clone in your cmd/terminal:
```
git clone https://github.com/xDeerz/Schizobot
```

## Setting up
You need to add your own responses to [respones.txt](https://github.com/xDeerz/Schizobot/blob/main/responses.txt).
Each line is a response for the bot. Add your bot token to the 95th line in [Schizobot.py](https://github.com/xDeerz/Schizobot/blob/b337c28aee4d6825f38f3482e688424f632011f2/Schizobot.py#L95)

## Running
You need to change your directory to the new files path, use cd in your cmd/terminal and run the code:
```
 cd "path\Schizobot"
 py "path\Schizobot"
```
## Known issues
If you're on windows and the code doesn't work, add ```, encoding='utf-8``` to the 24th line in [Schizobot.py](https://github.com/xDeerz/Schizobot/blob/b337c28aee4d6825f38f3482e688424f632011f2/Schizobot.py#L24) after ```'r'```. This shouldn't be an issue on linux though
